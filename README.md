# Date-Manipulation-and-Comparision
- This project demonstrates my mastery of object-oriented programming concepts like operator overloading, encapsulation, and date manipulation. 
- Encapsulation: The date class encapsulates properties and behaviors related to data handling. 
- Operator Overloading: Basic operations are defined to increment, decrement, and compare date objects. 
- Date Manipulation: The program can set, increment, and decrement dates which can be useful in certain software applications.
